# HTPC Browser Launcher

HTPC Browser Launcher is a small script for Ubuntu and other similar Linux distributions that launches a browser full screen.  It is currently compatible with only Chrome, Chromium and Firefox.  The script optionally allows control of the mouse pointer movement and clicking using Keynav which is convenient when using a TV remote.  Also, the script optionally opens lv.tedsblog.org which contains links to video streaming web sites.
